Main
	purpose:
		instantiates the graphics class
		instantiates the physics class
		instantiates the camera class
		instantiates the storage class
		instantiages the sound class
		uses the terrain generation class
		moves data between sub classes
		accepts control input (mouse, keyboard, controller)
		parses input?
		calls the draw command (from the graphics class)
		core game loop
		calculates and displays fps
		initiates the application
	other classes used:
		physics: uses it to perform block updates, check camera / world collsion, access / update block data
		graphics: uses it generate meshes and give them to the gpu
		camera: uses it to manage and update the view matrix and parse camera controls
		sound: uses it to play and manage sounds
		storage: used to read settings and worlds data from storage
	io:
		accepts keyboard / mouse input
		provides the game window and sounds

Physics
	purpose:
		calculate physics of the world, this includes entity/world collision and world block updates
		is given the cordinates of the camera each tick, it check collision and provides the new camera pos if there is a collision
		used to update / read block data from world cords
		keeps a list of sectors which then stores blocks
	other classes used:
		none
	io:
		accepts camera cordinates
		accepts update commands to block data

		provides block data (main class can read block data from this class)
		provides new camera cordinates after collision detection and correction

Graphics
	purpose:
		manages mesh data updates and memeory on the gpu
		wraps opengl api
	other classes used:
		sector: uses it to generate meshes
		vao: uses it to generate and manage vertex array objects in opengl
	io:
		accepts block data from the physics class
		accepts window size from the main class
		provides vertex array to the gpu (via opengl api)

Camera
	purpose:
		to manage the view matrix
		accepts input from the main class, calculates the new view matrix
		keeps track of camera's position within the world
	other classes used:
		none
	io:
		accepts 6DoF commands to update the view matrix, from the main class
		provides an updated (per tick) view matrix

Sound
	purpose:
		load sounds from files
		keep track of sounds
		play sounds on command
	other classes used:
		none
	io:
		accepts sound files from the storage device
		accepts commands to play sounds
		provides sounds

Blocks
	purpose:
		keeping track of unique block type data and tying them to block ids
		mapping block faces to the texture atlas
	other classes used:
		none
	io:
		accepts new unique block info from the main class (may be generated in a game class?)
		accepts the texture atlas size
		provides unique block data

Quad_Vao
	purpose:
		contains logic to create a vao within opengl easily
		this vao will be used exclusively to generate quads for greedy meshing the environment
	other classes used:
		none
	io:
		accepts opengl commands from the graphics class to create and manage vao's
		provides settings info on vao's

Sector:
	purpose:
		stores block data
		generates mesh for itself
	other classes used:
		none
	io:
		accepts block data from the physics class for block interactions
		accepts block data from terrain generator for the initial generation of blocks
		

Storage
	purpose:
		read/write world/entity/player data from/to disk
	other classes used:
		none
	io:
		accepts input from the storage device
		provides settings, world and player data

Terrain Generator
	purpose:
		holds the many algorithms for generating terrain
	other classes used:
		none
	io:
		accepts meta-parameters for terrain generation
		provides block data to the physics class
