Darker Voxel Engine is an game engine built on the Pyglet framework, in Python 3.
It's aim to to be able to quickly create voxel games (think Minecraft clone) within Python.
Since the Pyglet framework offers an openGL API to Python, it is able to achieve good framerate (100+ easily).

I am hoping to have this project completed by the end of 2022
